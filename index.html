        <h2>My Love 💙 Baby Theron</h2>
        <p>
            Happy Valentine’s Day, my love 💙 <br><br>
            I just want you to know how grateful I am to have you in my life.
            Every day with you feels special, comforting, and full of happiness.
            You are my safe place, my peace, and my greatest blessing. <br><br>
            Thank you for loving me, for understanding me,
            and for staying by my side through everything.
            You make my world brighter in ways you can’t even imagine. <br><br>
            With you, simple moments become unforgettable memories.
            Your smile, your voice, your presence —
            they all mean so much to me. <br><br>
            I may not always say it perfectly,
            but please remember that I love you deeply and sincerely.
            You are my today, my tomorrow, and my forever. 💙 <br><br>
            No matter where life takes us,
            I promise to cherish you, support you,
            and love you with all my heart. <br><br>
            I love you more than words can explain. 💙
        </p>
